11:43:53 <Austin-2> Hi, anyone online?
11:44:05 <ongardie> Austin-2: hey
11:44:31 <Austin-2> From the readme, if I can do ./obj.master/client
11:44:38 <Austin-2> should I be able to do: g++ -Lobj.master -lramcloud -Isrc -Iobj.master -o TestClient src/RamCloud.cc

12:16:51 <Austin-2> Hi, sorry, I think this irc client is broken
12:16:58 <Austin-2> If I can do this from the readme: ./obj.master/client
12:17:28 <Austin-2> should I be able to do: g++ -Lobj.master -lramcloud -Isrc -Iobj.master -o TestClient src/RamCloud.cc

14:44:21 <Austin-2> Hi! Anyone available for questions?
14:52:44 <ongardie> Austin-2: sorry, i'm not getting notifications for some reason
14:53:43 <ongardie> Austin-2:  i don't think RamCloud.cc has a main function. you should be able to just type 'make' to build that binary
14:55:23 <Austin-2> I see, thanks
14:55:58 <Austin-2> and you would recommend it as a building block for running a hello world application?
14:57:27 <ongardie> Austin-2: yeah, obj.master/client is a pretty simple example program, i think
14:57:35 <Austin-2> thanks
14:58:11 <ongardie> Austin-2: the source for that is src/ClientMain.cc, btw
14:59:12 <ongardie> i'll be back in half an hour
15:21:14 <ongardie> back
15:26:49 <Austin-2> What do you use to test the quality of your system? Do you only compare yourself against machines running the same size data? Do you look at speed, power, programmability? Cost of hardware?
15:30:41 <ongardie> Austin-2: can we take those one at a time?
15:31:28 <ongardie> Austin-2: quality: we do unit tests, some code reviews, a lot of benchmarking, and some (not enough) functional tests
15:32:09 <ongardie> or perhaps you mean to compare and contrast RAMCloud with other systems
15:32:17 <Austin-2> yes
15:32:21 <ongardie> i see
15:32:34 <ongardie> our "killer feature" is low latency access
15:33:09 <ongardie> our data model is quite basic right now: pretty much just get, set, and delete, so we're not really competing on that front yet
15:34:14 <ongardie> regarding cost of hardware, we think we provide the cheapest choice when you need the most I/O operations per second. of course for many less intensive workloads, flash and disk-based approaches will be cheaper
15:35:07 <ongardie> it's hard to compare based on capacity: hopefully you can build a RAMCloud cluster that will hold what you need to access at those speeds
15:40:20 <Austin-2> So you are not doing any empirical comparisons yet
15:40:43 <ongardie> Austin-2: no, we haven't
15:40:53 <Austin-2> thanks.

16:07:17 <Austin-2> Is this the best documentation of the functionality available in RamCloud? https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/docs/epydoc/
16:07:34 <Austin-2> then clicking on ramcloud.RamCloud class
16:07:40 <ongardie> no, not at all
16:07:56 <ongardie> that's for they python bindings, which are fairly undocumented and stale
16:08:01 <Austin-2> er, by functionality I mean the API calls (to know what all the parameters are and everything)
16:08:19 <Austin-2> oh I see
16:08:45 <ongardie> Austin-2: this is probably your best bet: https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/docs/doxygen/classRAMCloud_1_1RamCloud.html
16:09:02 <Austin-2> cool, thanks
