A genius was once stupid.
Do not fear going forward slowly, fear only to stand still.
Deep doubts, deep wisdom. Small doubts, little wisdom.
Be the first to the field, and the last to the couch.
Please help me! I am locked in a room and have been forced to forever write Proverbs!
Failure is not the end, it is growth.
Good fortune comes to those who bring good fortune onto others.
